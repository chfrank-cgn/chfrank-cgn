I'm Chris, and I'm an aspiring solution architect and cloud consultant living in Cologne, Germany.

I actively support the global movement for climate justice and am a fan of all things related to technology, travel, and movies. 

I'm active on [Mastodon](https://chaos.social/@chfrankcgn) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/chfrankcgn) and write a [blog](https://chfrank.net/wordpress/); all my other socials and publications are on my home page.

See you around!
